# Ceasar Cipher

This is my coding challenge submission for day #8 of the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp, instructor-led training.

This application encrypts and decrypts text messages using the latin alphabet. It takes 3 user inputs, the choice between encryption and decryption, the message and the shift number used for the encryption/decryption.

## Usage

```
Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt:
encode

Type your message:
Hello

Type the shift number:
5

Here's the encoded result: mjqqt
```
