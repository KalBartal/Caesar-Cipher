## 1. Introduction 
This program is used to encrypt and decrypt text messages using a Caesar Cipher. It is an implementation of the Caesar Cipher that uses a shift amount defined by the user. It based on a 26-character array representing lowercase letters ofthe alphabet, and an inner for loop for each letter of the text message to shift the letter by the specified shift amount.  

The code is straightforward and easy to use for anyone with a basic understanding of Python. It could be used by anyone who wants to encrypt or decrypt sensitive messages such as notes or instructions.

## 2. Installation
This program requires Python to be used. Before running the code, it must be written into an .py file in a text editor or IDE.

## 3. Usage
To run the code, first save it into a .py file in a text editor or IDE then run the file. This will display the instruction message:
```
Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt:
```

Input one of the following- `encode` to encrypt or `decode` to decrypt. 

The code then prompts for a message to be encrypted or decrypted:
```
Type your message:
```

Type in the the text message you wish to encrypt or decrypt.

The code then prompts for a shift amount:
```
Type the shift number:
```

Type in a positive or negative integer as the shift amount. This shift amount is used to encrypt/decrypt the message by shifting each letter in the message by the specified number.

The code then displays the encrypted or decrypted message:
```
Here's the encrypted/decrypted result: <Encrypted/Decrypted Message>
```

The result of the encrypted/decrypted message is displayed.
